The operation of the system is similar to the linear actuator system. By making forward and backward rotation on a linear system, the movement of the load connected to the motor is provided. The switches used serve as starting the rotation of the motor and as an emergency stop button. If the emergency stop button is pressed, the rotation stops; if the key is released, the engine can return to the starting position from where it was stopped.
Since the motor used in the project is an encoder motor, we can easily learn the step value taken by the motor. In addition, the control of the engine is provided by sending string data using the string data in the technical manual of the engine.
String data is transferred via UART pins using the STM32F103C8T6 Microprocessor. Since the microprocessor used does not support the RS485 protocol, PA9 and PA10 pins are connected to the DI and RO pins of the LTM2881CV-5 Transceiver Card to ensure communication with the engine that has the RS485 protocol. The switches connected with pull-up resistors are connected to PB6 and PB7 pins. The mentioned pins are used as interrupt pins. Additionally, by configuring PB1 pin as Analog Input, it enables analog values ​​to be read via the potentiometer. The read analog value is scaled on the software, allowing the rotation speed of the motor to be adjusted.
